<!-- Rolling the Dice -->
<a name="section591"></a><div class="section-title"><h2>1.1 Rolling the Dice</h2></div><div class="section">


Die rolls all have the same format:
<ol class="enumerate"><li>
<a name="item577"></a>Roll 1d20</li>
<li>
<a name="item578"></a>Add your Bonus</li>
<li>
<a name="item579"></a>Compare to target number. If you reach or exceed the target number, your roll succeeds.</li>
</ol>

<!-- Advantage and Disadvantage -->
<a name="subsection590"></a><div class="subsection-title"><h3>1.1.1 Advantage and Disadvantage</h3></div><div class="subsection">

  <a name="mark581" class="mark"></a>
  <a name="mark585" class="mark"></a>
  If you have an <strong>Advantage</strong> you roll one more die and choose the higher roll.  
  If you have a <strong>Disdvantage</strong> you roll one more die and choose the lower result.

  Advantage and Disadvantage don't stack, but cancel out each other.
  For example if a roll benefits from three distinct Advantages and one Disadvantage you roll two d20 and thoose the higher roll.
</div>

</div>


<!-- Disciplines, Maneuvers, and Power-Points -->
<a name="section607"></a><div class="section-title"><h2>1.2 Disciplines, Maneuvers, and Power-Points</h2></div><div class="section">

  <a name="mark592" class="mark"></a>
  Each Hero has special actions they can perform which are called <strong>Maneuvers</strong>.
  <strong>Maneuvers</strong> are organized in <strong>Disciplines</strong> where each rank of a <strong>Disciplines</strong> unlocks a new <strong>Maneuver</strong> or new options for existing ones.
  <strong>Discipline</strong> and their <strong>Maneuvers</strong> are made available to Heroes through their Ancestry and most importantly selected <strong>Class</strong>.

  <!-- Spending and Regaining Power-Points -->
<a name="subsection606"></a><div class="subsection-title"><h3>1.2.1 Spending and Regaining Power-Points</h3></div><div class="subsection">

    <a name="mark603" class="mark"></a>
    You start each day with a fixed number of Power-Points, typically three.
    You spend Power-Points to fuel active abilities and Maneuvers of your Hero.
    You regain spent Power-Points thru a special ability of your class.
    You also regain one Power-Point when you take a short rest to recover after an encounter.
  </div>

</div>


<!-- Actions -->
<a name="section612"></a><div class="section-title"><h2>1.3 Actions</h2></div><div class="section">

  On their turn a character can perform a <strong>Full Action</strong>, a <strong>Move Action</strong> and a <strong>Quick Action</strong>.
  Each character can also perform one <strong>Reaction</strong> per round.
</div>

<!-- Attacks and Defenses -->
<a name="section621"></a><div class="section-title"><h2>1.4 Attacks and Defenses</h2></div><div class="section">


Each Attack is a die roll against one of four defenses.
<ul class="itemize"><li>
<a name="item613"></a>Armor Class is determined by equipment the hero wears like armor and shields.</li>
<li>
<a name="item615"></a>Fortitude is equal to 10 + <strong>Toughness</strong> of the Hero.</li>
<li>
<a name="item617"></a>Reflex is equal to 10 + <strong>Dexterity</strong> of the Hero.</li>
<li>
<a name="item619"></a>Will is equal to 10 + <strong>Mind</strong> of the Hero.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<!-- Saves -->
<a name="section626"></a><div class="section-title"><h2>1.5 Saves</h2></div><div class="section">

<a name="mark622" class="mark"></a>
To save against a condition, roll a single d20. on a Roll of 11 or higher, you pass the saving throw.

<!-- Comment -->
<a name="subsection625"></a><div class="subsection-title"><h3>1.5.1 Comment</h3></div><div class="subsection">

  Why four defenses and a single save (like dnd 4) and not AC + 3 saves like other editions?
  Based on the assumption that player characters will cast more spells on more targets than NPCs, 
  binding spells to rolls made by the player gives them more to do instead of having the DM roll a lot of saves for a player action.
  This should increase the feeling of having the initiative for the players and makes larger numbers of enemies more manageable.
</div>

</div>


<!-- Hitpoints and Healing -->
<a name="section637"></a><div class="section-title"><h2>1.6 Hitpoints and Healing</h2></div><div class="section">

<a name="mark627" class="mark"></a>
Hitpoints at level 1 are determined by your class and the <strong>Toughness</strong> attribute.  
Each Level your hero gains they receive additional hitpoints. 
The number of hitpoints gained it determined by the class you choose for your hero.

<!-- Endurance -->
<a name="subsection634"></a><div class="subsection-title"><h3>1.6.1 Endurance</h3></div><div class="subsection">

  <a name="mark631" class="mark"></a>
  Each Hero has a number of Endurance Points which they use to regain Hit Points.
  The number of Endurance Points is determined by your class.

  When a Hero spends an Endurance Point they regain a number of Hit points equal to 1/4 of their maximum number of Hit Points.
</div>


<!-- Comment -->
<a name="subsection635"></a><div class="subsection-title"><h3>1.6.2 Comment</h3></div><div class="subsection">

  Hitpoints increase every level to give Players a constant feeling of getting stronger by simply having &quot;larger numbers&quot;.
  HP per level are not dependent on Toughness, as this would make the attribute an automatic choice for every tank character.
  Consider that Attribute values range from zero to six.
</div>


<!-- Temporary Hit points -->
<a name="subsection636"></a><div class="subsection-title"><h3>1.6.3 Temporary Hit points</h3></div><div class="subsection">

  Temporary hit points can be gained through some powers.
  They are reset to zero after a long rest.

  Temporary hit points don't stack.
</div>

</div>


<!-- Combat and Order of Turns -->
<a name="section683"></a><div class="section-title"><h2>1.7 Combat and Order of Turns</h2></div><div class="section">


Before a combat encounter starts, the DM tells the players what the surroundings are and what they can immediately see about the other combatants.
If one side tries to ambush the other side, those setting up the ambush roll stealth against the victims passive perception.
Players can also roll knowledge checks to see if their heroes have additional knowledge about their enemies.

A combat encounter is separated into rounds. Each round is again split into turns, with one turn per combatant.

Each combatant has the same set of actions available per round: One *Action*, one *Move*, and one *Quick*.

You can take actions in arbitrary order but each action has to be completed before you can start the next one.
In particular this means you cannot make your attack in the middle of a move without special abilities.

<!-- Combat Actions -->

   The fighter is intended to have a very &quot;in your face&quot; kind of play-style.
   Get into the thick of it and dish it out left, right, and center.
   Power-Points are (re-)gained during the fight. The Fighter does not start with many and thus does not have the alpha strike of a sorcerer.
   The Fighters different fighting styles cover the Fighter, Barbarian, and Ranger from dnd.
   If a player just wants to kill stuff they should build a fighter, focus on damage abilities and enjoy the carnage.

   The fighter has multiple ways of diversification. Two are the main class features:

   The fighting style lets the player chose a combat situation the Fighter excels in.
   Fighting Style and Equipment determine if the Fighter is a Tank or a Striker.

   The Martial Discipline is a discipline tree which defines how the Fighter regains Power-Points.
   Depending on the chosen discipline the fighter needs to act very differently during combat to maximise Power-Points.
   The martial discipline does not make the fighter more or less able to take damage.

   Equipment, in particular choice of weapons and armor has a large influence on the combat style of the fighter. More so than for any other class.

<!-- Rogue -->
<a name="section3392"></a><div class="section-title"><h2>5.2 Rogue</h2></div><div class="section">

<a name="mark3202" class="mark"></a>

You are a rogue, trickster, schemmer, scroundel.

Rogues specialize on exploiting every weakness they find in their enemies.
On face value, they don't appear very threatening, having a low number of hit points and wielding small weapons.
But once a rogue inevitably finds a weakness in their target, they show their true power using their *sneak attacks* for devastating effect.

<!-- Comment -->
<a name="subsection3205"></a><div class="subsection-title"><h3>5.2.1 Comment</h3></div><div class="subsection">

    The play-style of the rogue is focuses on exploiting opportunities.
    Without advantage, they do less damage than Fighters and have a smaller selection of abilities than Sorcerers or Druids.
    Their combat abilities are built around the Sneak Attack discipline.
    They only have one static &quot;dimension&quot; of diversification in their Scum and Villainy feature
    but the Sneak Attack discipline has many more branching points where choices influence the character than disciplines of other classes.

    Most Rogue Discipline cost Power-Point.
    Unlike the Fighter (or Wizard Cantrips) there are very few free Maneuvers.

    Maneuvers give mostly buffs and movement effects.
    Sneak Attack supports debuffs on Enemies and additional damage.

    Sorcerers are the catchall spellcaster class.
    Of all classes, they have the largest number of active abilities available as many of their disciplines add new powers with higher ranks.
    Wizards have more utility, Warlocks deal more damage.

    Sorcerers have more diversity and utilities in their abilities than godsworn or druids.
    They are very much focussed on their spell abilities and lack the defining abilities
    of godsworn and druids which are not active spells.

    Higher level Abilities of Sorcerers are often new powerful spells.
    This differentiates them from Godsworn Disciplines which mostly add effects and options to a base Maneuver.

    A druid first chooses the Call of the Wild discipline which has the largest influence on its play-style.
    It determines its role as striker, tank, healer, or controller.
    The circle then sets the relationship to the other heroes.
    Does the druid better fight alone, next to the others and does he help them, or benefit from them?

    Druids have less raw spell power than sorcerers but their Call of the Wild sets them apart.
    Their higher level spell abilities tend to be modifications of a common spell.

    Druid have the strongest force movement disciplines of all caster classes.
    They focus on poison and storm damage, while Godsworn focus on fire damage,
    Druid spells do less damage than Godsworn spells on average.

As a Godsworn you have bound your service to a higher cause or a God from the spiritual realm.

Four powers are fueled by your face and unbreakable conviction.

<!-- Comment -->
<a name="subsection4611"></a><div class="subsection-title"><h3>5.5.1 Comment</h3></div><div class="subsection">

    Godsworn are basically Clerics, Paladins and Dnd 4e Avengers rolled together.
    Their oath determines what they are good at and the domains of their gods specify how they regain Power-Points and thus greatly influence play-style.
    The domain has a smaller effect than the Oath. Some domains give access to abilities of other classes.
    These domains are intended for players who like to spend time tinkering.

    Weapon abilities of Godsworn are less straight forward than those of fighters.
    A damage dealer Godsworn depends more on secondary damage effects than the high damage dice of a Fighter or the large damage dice count of a Rogue.

    Abilities of Godsworn and Druids are similar.
    Druids do more &quot;nature&quot; related damage like Poison and Lightning.

<!-- Comment -->
<a name="subsection4985"></a><div class="subsection-title"><h3>6.1.10 Comment</h3></div><div class="subsection">

    Nine Skills seems like a manageable number, which still covers the typical situations of a dungeon crawler.
    Since Backgrounds give one or two proficiencies, Ancestries give one and classes give two, a group of four heroes should be able to cover all skills.
    The Lore skills (Arcane, Religion, Nature) should allow nearly every character to be able to be the expert on a given enemy type once in a while.
    Specialized knowledge is covered by tool/trade proficiencies.
    In particular medicine is covered by proficiency in healers kit.

    The herbalist discipline allows characters who are not spellcasters and do not necessarily have a high *mind* stat to heal and buff their allies.
    This way one can build a forest ranger type character who supports their allies without resorting to magic.

    Blade Weapons have the greatest utility but generally do one die type less damage than Axes.
    Talents and Maneuvers targeting blade Weapons are better than those for Axes and Hammers.
    Axes have the highest potential for damage having the *devastating* attribute and talents supporting conditionally damage boni.
    Hammers are have the highest average damage. Talents supporting hammers add debuffs that are useful for low damage builds.
    Crossbows do more damage than bows, but the `Load` Attribute limits them to one attack per round.
    Thrown Weapons do even less damage but provide versatility by being one-handed and also usable as melee weapons.

    Everyone can wear every armor, there are no restriction for class or attribute values.
    Talents and Magic Items encourage using lighter armor to advance certain play-styles.

<!-- Fanmail -->
<a name="section6137"></a><div class="section-title"><h2>9.1 Fanmail</h2></div><div class="section">

If a player or his character does anything that pleases the other players (including the GM), he can get a point of fanmail for that;
players suggest people for fanmail, and unless someone has a veto, they get the point.
You can't give fanmail to yourself, though.
Fanmail can be accumulated endlessly, and there is no strict limit on how many may be given, but more than 5 per player per session of play should be highly unusual
Per thing that pleases, only one fanmail may be given, even if it pleases multiple players.

Stuff that might qualify include athmospheric roleplaying, a clever joke, a clever tactic,
taking one for the team or other teamplay, being very useful in the adventure and advancing the plot, as a consolation for some frustration suffered during play (but endured well) etc.

You may also award fanmail for certain out of game things like writing a session report, creating a map or other illustration etc.
fanmail can then be used for (temporary) advantages during play; once it has been used it is gone and must be earned anew.

<ul class="itemize"><li>
<a name="item6128"></a>1 pt: can be used like a point of endurance or a powerpoint</li>
<li>
<a name="item6129"></a>1 pt: add 1d4 bonus to a d20 or damage roll</li>
<li>
<a name="item6130"></a>3 pts: reroll a d20 check or damage roll, taking the better result</li>
<li>
<a name="item6131"></a>6 pts: add a second action to your turn</li>
</ul>

Generally speaking, you may not gain stuff you already have from the normal rules; so for example if you attack with advantage, you can't reroll that attack - you already rolled 2 dice and picked the better one

There is also *some* player empowerment:

<ul class="itemize"><li>
<a name="item6133"></a>for 3 points you can introduce a minor fact or friendly NPC</li>
<li>
<a name="item6134"></a>for 6 points you can introduce a major fact or powerful/ very useful friendly NPC</li>
<li>
<a name="item6135"></a>for 9 points you can have a miracle happen, save someone's life ingame or the like</li>
</ul>

New players who join the group start with 5 fanmail.
