<!-- Design Goals -->
<a name="section264"></a><div class="section-title"><h2>1.1 Design Goals</h2></div><div class="section">

<ul class="itemize"><li>
<a name="item260"></a>Heroes kick ass! The characters are larger than life heroes and should feel like that.</li>
<li>
<a name="item261"></a>Tactical combat, combat is dangerous and requires good decision making and flexibility. It must never be a case of just going through an optimal skill rotation.</li>
<li>
<a name="item262"></a>Accessable, the rules should be easy to understand and allow people to quickly start playing.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<!-- Secondary Goals -->
<a name="section271"></a><div class="section-title"><h2>1.2 Secondary Goals</h2></div><div class="section">

<ul class="itemize"><li>
<a name="item265"></a>Decisions are important, every decision during character creation and play should feel significant. There shall be no must haves</li>
<li>
<a name="item266"></a>No noob traps. There shall be now bad options during character creation. If any option is never taken because its alternatives are plain better, we will fix it.</li>
<li>
<a name="item267"></a>The intuitive option has to work. When a total beginner builds a straight forward character and makes his choices based on what seems right, it should not be wrong. Less apparent ideas might require more consideration and insight into the system but everyone should be able to build a &quot;Kill Stuff with a giant Axe&quot; type of character that kicks ass.</li>
<li>
<a name="item268"></a>Consistent Core Rules. Once a player gets a grasp how the rules work, it should be easy to guess how they apply to a specific situation.
Never should anybody but the player of a character need to know the specific rules of that character.</li>
<li>
<a name="item269"></a>Good Balancing, try to always make different options well balanced. This is a continous process.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<!-- What Aaargh is not -->
<a name="section276"></a><div class="section-title"><h2>1.3 What Aaargh is not</h2></div><div class="section">

<ul class="itemize"><li>
<a name="item272"></a>A Simulation, Aaargh is focused on action and dangerous adventures in a fantastic world. It does not simulate the reality.</li>
<li>
<a name="item273"></a>A game of subtle horror, Characters in Aaargh are larger than life heroes who are scared of very few things.</li>
<li>
<a name="item274"></a>Balanced for player versus player fights.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<!-- Design Principles -->
<a name="section283"></a><div class="section-title"><h2>1.4 Design Principles</h2></div><div class="section">

<ul class="itemize"><li>
<a name="item277"></a>As much as necessary as little as possible!
Every rule and every character option has to justified and improve the game.
Prefer a chain of options instead of one large pool.</li>
<li>
<a name="item278"></a>Rules work together!
We try to make sure all parts of the rule system interact with one another.
They should never feel like a set of parallel or tacked-on parts.</li>
<li>
<a name="item279"></a>Prefer simple operations!
We want to minimize the cognitive burden put on players.
Thus, both the number of and the strength of calculations necessary during play should be low.
Comparing to numbers is simpler than calculation. Addition is simpler than subtraction.
Multiplication with and division by any other number than 10 and 2 is to be avoided.</li>
<li>
<a name="item280"></a>Avoid Bookkeeping!
We avoid resources with large numbers as they usually requires more calculations.
Numbers should be kept in a range, where they can be easily represented by small physical tokens.
7 is often a good maximum for numbers which a human is to keep in their mind.
Hit Points might be an exception.</li>
<li>
<a name="item281"></a>Avoid bonus stacking!
Players should not be required to add more than 3 to 4 numbers to calculate the result of a roll.
Having a lot of different manipulators in play makes it hard to estimate the effect of a given choice or action.
In particular avoid dynamic and situational modifiers. Use advantage and disadvantage instead.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Core Rules -->
<a name="chapter961"></a><center><h1 class="chapter">2 Core Rules</h1></center>

<!-- Rolling the Dice -->
<a name="section780"></a><div class="section-title"><h2>2.1 Rolling the Dice</h2></div><div class="section">


Die rolls all have the same format:
<ol class="enumerate"><li>
<a name="item763"></a>Roll 1d20</li>
<li>
<a name="item764"></a>Add your Bonus</li>
<li>
<a name="item765"></a>Compare to target number. If you reach or exceed the target number, your roll succeeds.</li>
</ol>

Typically you will add the following boni to the die:
<ul class="itemize"><li>
<a name="item767"></a>The value of the approriate attribute</li>
<li>
<a name="item768"></a>Your Proficiency Bonus. It starts as a +2 bonus and can be increased when your hereo gains levels.  Add it to attack rolls and skill rolls when you are Proficient in the skill.</li>
<li>
<a name="item769"></a>A bonus from Legendary Items if you have an approriate item with a bonus</li>
</ul>


<!-- Advantage and Disadvantage -->
<a name="subsection779"></a><div class="subsection-title"><h3>2.1.1 Advantage and Disadvantage</h3></div><div class="subsection">

  <a name="mark771" class="mark"></a>
  <a name="mark774" class="mark"></a>
  If you have an <strong>Advantage</strong> you roll one more die and choose the higher roll.  
  If you have a <strong>Disdvantage</strong> you roll one more die and choose the lower result.

  Advantage and Disadvantage don't stack, but cancel out each other.
  For example if a roll benefits from three distinct Advantages and one Disadvantage you roll two d20 and thoose the higher roll.
</div>

</div>


<!-- Disciplines, Maneuvers, and Power-Points -->
<a name="section796"></a><div class="section-title"><h2>2.2 Disciplines, Maneuvers, and Power-Points</h2></div><div class="section">

  <a name="mark781" class="mark"></a>
  Each Hero has special actions they can perform which are called <strong>Maneuvers</strong>.
  <strong>Maneuvers</strong> are organized in <strong>Disciplines</strong> where each rank of a <strong>Disciplines</strong> unlocks a new <strong>Maneuver</strong> or new options for existing ones.
  <strong>Discipline</strong> and their <strong>Maneuvers</strong> are made available to Heroes through their Ancestry and most importantly selected <strong>Class</strong>.

  <!-- Spending and Regaining Power-Points -->
<a name="subsection795"></a><div class="subsection-title"><h3>2.2.1 Spending and Regaining Power-Points</h3></div><div class="subsection">

    <a name="mark792" class="mark"></a>
    You start each day with a fixed number of Power-Points, typically three.
    You spend Power-Points to fuel active abilities and Maneuvers of your Hero.
    You regain spent Power-Points thru a special ability of your class.
    You also regain one Power-Point when you take a short rest to recover after an encounter.
  </div>

</div>


<!-- Actions -->
<a name="section801"></a><div class="section-title"><h2>2.3 Actions</h2></div><div class="section">

  On their turn a character can perform a <strong>Full Action</strong>, a <strong>Move Action</strong> and a <strong>Quick Action</strong>.
  Each character can also perform one <strong>Reaction</strong> per round.
</div>

<!-- Attacks and Defenses -->
<a name="section810"></a><div class="section-title"><h2>2.4 Attacks and Defenses</h2></div><div class="section">


Each Attack is a die roll against one of four defenses.
<ul class="itemize"><li>
<a name="item802"></a>Armor Class is determined by equipment the hero wears like armor and shields.</li>
<li>
<a name="item804"></a>Fortitude is equal to 10 + <strong>Toughness</strong> of the Hero.</li>
<li>
<a name="item806"></a>Reflex is equal to 10 + <strong>Dexterity</strong> of the Hero.</li>
<li>
<a name="item808"></a>Will is equal to 10 + <strong>Mind</strong> of the Hero.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<!-- Saves -->
<a name="section816"></a><div class="section-title"><h2>2.5 Saves</h2></div><div class="section">

<a name="mark811" class="mark"></a>
To save against a condition, roll a single d20. on a Roll of 11 or higher, you pass the saving throw.

<p><table cellspacing="0" class="color" cellpadding="0"><tbody>
<tr><td bgcolor="#ead8d2">
  Why four defenses and a single save (like dnd 4) and not AC + 3 saves like other editions?
  Based on the assumption that player characters will cast more spells on more targets than NPCs, 
  binding spells to rolls made by the player gives them more to do instead of having the DM roll a lot of saves for a player action.
  This should increase the feeling of having the initiative for the players and makes larger numbers of enemies more manageable.
</td></tr>
</tbody></table></p>
</div>


<!-- Hitpoints and Healing -->
<a name="section828"></a><div class="section-title"><h2>2.6 Hitpoints and Healing</h2></div><div class="section">

<a name="mark817" class="mark"></a>
Hitpoints at level 1 are determined by your class and the <strong>Toughness</strong> attribute.  
Each Level your hero gains they receive additional hitpoints. 
The number of hitpoints gained it determined by the class you choose for your hero.

<!-- Endurance -->
<a name="subsection824"></a><div class="subsection-title"><h3>2.6.1 Endurance</h3></div><div class="subsection">

  <a name="mark821" class="mark"></a>
  Each Hero has a number of Endurance Points which they use to regain Hit Points.
  The number of Endurance Points is determined by your class.

  When a Hero spends an Endurance Point they regain a number of Hit points equal to 1/4 of their maximum number of Hit Points.
</div>


<p><table cellspacing="0" class="color" cellpadding="0"><tbody>
<tr><td bgcolor="#ead8d2">
  Hitpoints increase every level to give Players a constant feeling of getting stronger by simply having &quot;larger numbers&quot;.
  HP per level are not dependent on Toughness, as this would make the attribute an automatic choice for every tank character.
  Consider that Attribute values range from zero to six.
</td></tr>

<!-- Temporary Hit points -->
<a name="subsection827"></a><div class="subsection-title"><h3>2.6.2 Temporary Hit points</h3></div><div class="subsection">

  Temporary hit points can be gained through some powers.
  They are reset to zero after a long rest.

  Temporary hit points don't stack.

<!-- Combat and Order of Turns -->
<a name="section876"></a><div class="section-title"><h2>2.7 Combat and Order of Turns</h2></div><div class="section">


Before a combat encounter starts, the DM tells the players what the surroundings are and what they can immediately see about the other combatants.
If one side tries to ambush the other side, those setting up the ambush roll stealth against the victims passive perception.
Players can also roll knowledge checks to see if their heroes have additional knowledge about their enemies.

A combat encounter is separated into rounds. Each round is again split into turns, with one turn per combatant.

Each combatant has the same set of actions available per round: One *Action*, one *Move*, and one *Quick*.

You can take actions in arbitrary order but each action has to be completed before you can start the next one.
In particular this means you cannot make your attack in the middle of a move without special abilities.

<a name="section1102"></a><div class="section-title"><h2>4.2 Background</h2></div><div class="section">

   Next chose a Background for your Hero.
   The background of your hero defines where they came from and what they did before becoming an adventurer.
   Each background provides your hero with proficiency in some skills as well as a unique trait.
   Background traits can be used outside of combat and give each hero a unique ability to help the group during their adventures.

   Available Backgrounds are:
   <ol class="enumerate"><li>
<a name="item1093"></a>Commoner</li>
<li>
<a name="item1094"></a>Criminal</li>
<li>
<a name="item1095"></a>Noble</li>

</ol>
</div>


<!-- Heroes Path -->
<a name="section1109"></a><div class="section-title"><h2>4.3 Heroes Path</h2></div><div class="section">

   After having chosen a background you chose your heroes path.
   The chosen path of a hero defines how they fight and approach the many dangerous situations and problems during your adventures.
   Each path provides a large selection of disciplines as well as some passive traits.
   In particular, you have to make a choice how regain Power-Points to enhance your abilities. 

   Available Paths are:
   <ol class="enumerate"><li>
<a name="item1103"></a>Druid</li>
<li>
<a name="item1104"></a>Fighter</li>
<li>
<a name="item1105"></a>Godsworn</li>
<li>
<a name="item1106"></a>Rogue</li>

</ol>
</div>


<!-- Attributes -->
<a name="section1110"></a><div class="section-title"><h2>4.4 Attributes</h2></div><div class="section">

   After you have chosen a path you should have a good idea which attributes your hero is going to use the most.
   You now have to put five points into the three Attributes `Toughness`, `Dexterity`, `Mind`.
   No Attribute can have an initial value below zero or higher than three.
</div>

<!-- Equipment -->
<a name="section1111"></a><div class="section-title"><h2>4.5 Equipment</h2></div><div class="section">

   Finally, it's time to buy some starting equipment.
   At first level you do not have access to magical and legendary equipment yet.
   But your hero should have all necessary basic equipment like a simple suit of armor and a weapon.

You are a Fighter! You best foes with physical might and superior martial prowess.

<p><table cellspacing="0" class="color" cellpadding="0"><tbody>

   The Fighter is intended to have a very &quot;in your face&quot; kind of play-style.
   Get into the thick of it and dish it out left, right, and center.
   Power-Points are (re-)gained during the fight. The Fighter does not start with many and thus does not have the alpha strike of a sorcerer.
   The Fighters different fighting styles cover the Fighter, Barbarian, and Ranger from dnd.
   If a player just wants to kill stuff they should build a Fighter, focus on damage abilities and enjoy the carnage.
   <br/>
   The Fighter has multiple ways of diversification. Two are the main class features:
   <br/>
   The fighting style lets the player chose a combat situation the Fighter excels in.
   Fighting Style and Equipment determine if the Fighter is a Tank or a Striker.
   <br/>
   The Martial Discipline is a discipline tree which defines how the Fighter regains Power-Points.
   Depending on the chosen discipline the Fighter needs to act very differently during combat to maximise Power-Points.
   The martial discipline does not make the Fighter more or less able to take damage.
   <br/>
   Equipment, in particular choice of weapons and armor has a large influence on the combat style of the Fighter. More so than for any other class.

<a name="mark3366" class="mark"></a>

You are a rogue, trickster, schemmer, scroundel.

Rogues specialize on exploiting every weakness they find in their enemies.
On face value, they don't appear very threatening, having a low number of hit points and wielding small weapons.
But once a rogue inevitably finds a weakness in their target, they show their true power using their *sneak attacks* for devastating effect.

<p><table cellspacing="0" class="color" cellpadding="0"><tbody>
<tr><td bgcolor="#ead8d2">
    The play-style of the rogue is focuses on exploiting opportunities.
    Without advantage, they do less damage than Fighters and have a smaller selection of abilities than Sorcerers or Druids.
    Their combat abilities are built around the Sneak Attack discipline.
    They only have one static &quot;dimension&quot; of diversification in their Scum and Villainy feature
    but the Sneak Attack discipline has many more branching points where choices influence the character than disciplines of other classes.
   <br/>
    Most Rogue Discipline cost Power-Point.
    Unlike the Fighter (or Wizard Cantrips) there are very few free Maneuvers.
   <br/>
    Maneuvers give mostly buffs and movement effects.
    Sneak Attack supports debuffs on Enemies and additional damage.

    Sorcerers are the catchall spellcaster class.
    Of all classes, they have the largest number of active abilities available as many of their disciplines add new powers with higher ranks.
    Wizards have more utility, Warlocks deal more damage.
   <br/>
    Sorcerers have more diversity and utilities in their abilities than godsworn or druids.
    They are very much focussed on their spell abilities and lack the defining abilities
    of godsworn and druids which are not active spells.
   <br/>
    Higher level Abilities of Sorcerers are often new powerful spells.
    This differentiates them from Godsworn Disciplines which mostly add effects and options to a base Maneuver.

<tr><td bgcolor="#ead8d2">
    Godsworn are basically Clerics, Paladins and Dnd 4e Avengers rolled together.
    Their oath determines what they are good at and the domains of their gods specify how they regain Power-Points and thus greatly influence play-style.
    The domain has a smaller effect than the Oath. Some domains give access to abilities of other classes.
    These domains are intended for players who like to spend time tinkering.
   <br/>
    Weapon abilities of Godsworn are less straight forward than those of fighters.
    A damage dealer Godsworn depends more on secondary damage effects than the high damage dice of a Fighter or the large damage dice count of a Rogue.
   <br/>
    Abilities of Godsworn and Druids are similar.
    Druids do more &quot;nature&quot; related damage like Poison and Lightning.
    Godsworn do more fire damage.
    The main difference between Godsworn and Druids are in their class features.

    Blade Weapons have the greatest utility but generally do one die type less damage than Axes.
    Talents and Maneuvers targeting blade Weapons are better than those for Axes and Hammers.
    Axes have the highest potential for damage having the *devastating* attribute and talents supporting conditionally damage boni.
    Hammers are have the highest average damage. Talents supporting hammers add debuffs that are useful for low damage builds.
    Crossbows do more damage than bows, but the `Load` Attribute limits them to one attack per round.
    Thrown Weapons do even less damage but provide versatility by being one-handed and also usable as melee weapons.
   <br/>
    Everyone can wear every armor, there are no restriction for class or attribute values.
    Talents and Magic Items encourage using lighter armor to advance certain play-styles.

<!-- Optional and Experimental Rules -->

<!-- Fanmail -->
<a name="section6735"></a><div class="section-title"><h2>10.1 Fanmail</h2></div><div class="section">

If a player or his character does anything that pleases the other players (including the GM), he can get a point of fanmail for that;
players suggest people for fanmail, and unless someone has a veto, they get the point.
You can't give fanmail to yourself, though.
Fanmail can be accumulated endlessly, and there is no strict limit on how many may be given, but more than 5 per player per session of play should be highly unusual
Per thing that pleases, only one fanmail may be given, even if it pleases multiple players.

Stuff that might qualify include athmospheric roleplaying, a clever joke, a clever tactic,
taking one for the team or other teamplay, being very useful in the adventure and advancing the plot, as a consolation for some frustration suffered during play (but endured well) etc.

You may also award fanmail for certain out of game things like writing a session report, creating a map or other illustration etc.
fanmail can then be used for (temporary) advantages during play; once it has been used it is gone and must be earned anew.

<ul class="itemize"><li>
<a name="item6726"></a>1 pt: can be used like a point of endurance or a powerpoint</li>
<li>
<a name="item6727"></a>1 pt: add 1d4 bonus to a d20 or damage roll</li>
<li>
<a name="item6728"></a>3 pts: reroll a d20 check or damage roll, taking the better result</li>
<li>
<a name="item6729"></a>6 pts: add a second action to your turn</li>
</ul>

Generally speaking, you may not gain stuff you already have from the normal rules; so for example if you attack with advantage, you can't reroll that attack - you already rolled 2 dice and picked the better one

There is also *some* player empowerment:

<ul class="itemize"><li>
<a name="item6731"></a>for 3 points you can introduce a minor fact or friendly NPC</li>
<li>
<a name="item6732"></a>for 6 points you can introduce a major fact or powerful/ very useful friendly NPC</li>
<li>
<a name="item6733"></a>for 9 points you can have a miracle happen, save someone's life ingame or the like</li>
</ul>

New players who join the group start with 5 fanmail.
