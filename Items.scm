The Equipment rules are not realistic.
They are designed to be fun and enable strong visuals and action scenes.

For Weapon focused Heroes the choice of weapon is a choice of damage potential vs secondary effects and utility vs defense.
The damage of spellcasters does not depend as much on the weapon.
Thus, it is a choice between different utilities and secondary effects and defense.

,(section :title [Weapon Properties][
* Versatile: The weapon can be used one-handed or two-handed. If used two-handed the damage die increases by one type.
* Reach: The weapon can be used to attack enemies up to 10ft away.
* 2H: The weapon can only be used with two hands.
* Devastating: Critical hits with this weapon deal extra damage. A critical hit deals an extra 1W damage at levels 1-10, 2W at levels 11-20 and 3W at levels 21 to 25.
* Sharp(x): When rolling the weaponâ€™s damage results in a roll lower than the sharp value of the weapon for any die, the damage of that roll is considered the sharp value of the weapon instead.
* Load: After making an attack with the weapon, the user needs to spend an action to reload the weapon, before they can attack with it again.
* Light: Melee Attacks with this Weapon can be made with *Dexterity* or *Toughness*.

,(section :title [Comment][
Blade Weapons have the greatest utility but generally do one die type less damage than Axes.
Talents and Maneuvers targeting blade Weapons are better than those for Axes and Hammers.
Axes have the highest potential for damage having the *devastating* attribute and talents supporting conditionally damage boni.
Hammers are have the highest average damage. Talents supporting hammers add debuffs that are useful for low damage builds.
Crossbows do more damage than bows, but the `Load` Attribute limits them to one attack per round.
Thrown Weapons do even less damage but provide versatility by being one-handed and also usable as melee weapons.

Everyone can wear every armor, there are no restriction for class or attribute values.
Talents and Magic Items encourage using lighter armor to advance certain play-styles.

,(section :title [Magic and Legendary Items][
,(subsection :title [Comment][
Legendary Items are basically part of the characters.
They are highly relevant to balancing and often part of a character build. (As magic items tend to be in Dnd)

Legendary Items do not have prices attached.

Magic Items are weaker, smaller etc.
They can be bought and sold.

If an item is powerful and specific enough to be part of a character build, it should be a legendary item.
