# Rule Engine

### Comment: 
Very basic draft to give an idea how it is supposed to work.

#### Design Principles:
Prefer simple operations! We want to minimize the cognitive burden put on players. 
Thus both the number of and the strength of calculations necessary during play should be low.
Comparing to numbers is simpler than calculation. Addition is simpler than subtraction.
Multiplication and division by any other number than 10 and 2 is to be avoided.

As a consequence we avoid bookkeeping as it usually requires more calculations. Hit Points might be an exception.

We try to avoid bonus stacking. Players should not be required to add more than 3 to 4 numbers to calculate the result of a roll.
Having a lot of different manipulators in play makes it hard to estimate the effect of a given choice or action.

### Rolling the Dice

Die rolls all have the same format:
* Roll 1d20 
* Add your Bonus
* Compare to target number

If you reach or exceed the target number, your roll succeeds.

### Advantage and Disadvantage
If you have an *advantage* you roll one more die and chose the higher roll.  
If you have a *disadvantage* you roll one more die and chose the lower result.

### Open Questions:
1d20  or 2d10 roll?  
1d20 is simpler but 2d10 makes extreme results less likely and the effects of advantage and disadvantage are less drastic.

"Players roll all the dice" build into the core rules?
