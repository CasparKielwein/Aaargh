# Classes
Each Hero has one *Class*, which determines the majority of his playing options.
Each *Class* provides several *Disciplines* to choose from.

## Fighter

### Comment
The fighter is intended to have a very "in your face" kind of play-style.
Get into the thick of it and dish it out left, right, and center.
Power-Points are (re-)gained during the fight. The Fighter does not start with many and thus does not have the alpha strike of a sorcerer.
The Fighters different fighting styles cover the Fighter, Barbarian, and Ranger from dnd.
If a player just wants to kill stuff they should build a fighter, focus on damage abilities and enjoy the carnage.

The fighter has multiple ways of diversification. Two are the main class features:

The fighting style lets the player chose a combat situation the Fighter excels in.
Fighting Style and Equipment determine if the Fighter is a Tank or a Striker.

The Martial Discipline is a discipline tree which defines how the Fighter regains Power-Points.
Depending on the chosen discipline the fighter needs to act very differently during combat to maximise Power-Points.
The martial discipline does not make the fighter more or less able to take damage.

Equipment, in particular choice of weapons and armor has a large influence on the combat style of the fighter. More so than for any other class.

## Sorcerer

### Comment
Sorcerers are the catchall spellcaster class.
Of all classes, they have the largest number of active abilities available as many of their disciplines add new powers with higher ranks.
Wizards have more utility, Warlocks deal more damage.

Sorcerers have more diversity and utilities in their abilities than godsworn or druids.
They are very much focussed on their spell abilities and lack the defining abilities
of godsworn and druids which are not active spells.

Higher level Abilities of Sorcerers are often new powerful spells.
This differentiates them from Godsworn Disciplines which mostly add effects and options to a base Maneuver.

### Proficiencies
__Skill Proficiency:__ Choose two skills from the following: Arcane, History, Heal, Streetwise  

__Starting Hit Points:__ 6 + Tough

### Power Source

## Druid

### Comment
A druid first chooses the Call of the Wild discipline which has the largest influence on its play-style.
It determines its role as striker, tank, healer, or controller.
The circle then sets the relationship to the other heroes.
Does the druid better fight alone, next to the others and does he help them, or benefit from them?

Druids have less raw spell power than sorcerers but their Call of the Wild sets them apart.
Their higher level spell abilities tend to be modifications of a common spell.

Druid have the strongest force movement disciplines of all caster classes.
They focus on poison and storm damage, while Godsworn focus on fire damage,
Druid spells do less damage than Godsworn spells on average.

## Rogue
Rogues specialize on exploiting every weakness they find in their enemies.
On face value, they don't appear very threatening, having a low number of hit points and wielding small weapons.
But once a rogue inevitably finds a weakness in their target, they show their true power using their *sneak attacks* for devastating effect.

### Comment
The play-style of the rogue is focuses on exploiting opportunities.
Without advantage, they do less damage than Fighters and have a smaller selection of abilities than Sorcerers or Druids.
Their combat abilities are built around the Sneak Attack discipline.
They only have one static "dimension" of diversification in their Scum and Villainy feature
but the Sneak Attack discipline has many more branching points where choices influence the character than disciplines of other classes.

Most Rogue Discipline cost Power-Point.
Unlike the Fighter (or Wizard Cantrips) there are very few free Maneuvers.

Maneuvers give mostly buffs and movement effects.
Sneak Attack supports debuffs on Enemies and additional damage.

## Godsworn
As a Godsworn you have bound your service to a higher cause or a God from the spiritual realm.

### Comment
Godsworn are basically Clerics, Paladins and Dnd 4e Avengers rolled together.
Their oath determines what they are good at and the domains of their gods specify how they regain Power-Points and thus greatly influence play-style.
The domain has a smaller effect than the Oath. Some domains give access to abilities of other classes.
These domains are intended for players who like to spend time tinkering.

Weapon abilities of Godsworn are less straight forward than those of fighters.
A damage dealer Godsworn depends more on secondary damage effects than the high damage dice of a Fighter or the large damage dice count of a Rogue.

Abilities of Godsworn and Druids are similar.
Druids do more "nature" related damage like Poison and Lightning.
Godsworn do more fire damage.
The main difference between Godsworn and Druids are in their class features.
