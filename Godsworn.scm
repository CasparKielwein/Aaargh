,(index "Godsworn")

As a Godsworn you have bound your service to a higher cause or a God from the spiritual realm.

Four powers are fueled by your face and unbreakable conviction.

,(subsection :title [Comment][
Godsworn are basically Clerics, Paladins and Dnd 4e Avengers rolled together.
Their oath determines what they are good at and the domains of their gods specify how they regain Power-Points and thus greatly influence play-style.
The domain has a smaller effect than the Oath. Some domains give access to abilities of other classes.
These domains are intended for players who like to spend time tinkering.

Weapon abilities of Godsworn are less straight forward than those of fighters.
A damage dealer Godsworn depends more on secondary damage effects than the high damage dice of a Fighter or the large damage dice count of a Rogue.

Abilities of Godsworn and Druids are similar.
Druids do more "nature" related damage like Poison and Lightning.
Godsworn do more fire damage.
The main difference between Godsworn and Druids are in their class features.
