### Comment
Nine Skills seems like a manageable number, which still covers the typical situations of a dungeon crawler.
Since Backgrounds give one or two proficiencies and classes give three, a group of four heroes should be able to cover all skills.
The Lore skills (Arcane, Religion, Nature) should allow nearly every character to be able to be the expert on a given eneemy type once in a while.
Specialized knowledge is covered by tool/trade proficiencies.
In particular medicine is covered by proficiency in healers kit.


## Skill Disciplines
You can learn and advance in skill Disciplines if you are proficient in the related skill.
They allow you to develop a character in a direction not dictated by the choice of class.

### Ritualist (Arcane, Religion)
You know how to perform powerful rituals.
These take more time to cast than normal spells and might require exotic materials as paraphernalia.

### Herbalist (Nature)
You know how to collect and use herbs and other natural ingredients for their helpful effects.

#### Comment
The herbalist discipline allows characters who are not spellcasters and do not necessarily have a high *mind* stat to heal and buff their allies.
This way one can build a forest ranger type character who supports their allies without resorting to magic.

### "Jump Very High" (Athletics)
While heroes with a high bonus in *Athletics* can already jump considerable distances and heights this discipline takes them to a superhuman level.

### Discover Weakness (Perception)


### Stealth

### Disarming Presence (Charm)
Target enemies which gain disadvantage when attacking you.
If you have marked the target, the mark is removed. If you mark a target effected by *Disarming Presence*, the disarming presence is lost emmediately.

### Distract (Streetwise)
For people who like to play heroes who don't focus on armed fighting.

### Frighten (Intimidate)
Use Intimidate as attacks to hinder enemies and possibly cause them to flee.

### Armor Monger (Trade Smith / Armorer)
Improve equipment during rests, spend maneuver points for small bonuses.

### Alchemist (Alchemy Kit)
Put buffs and other spells into alchemical concoctions.
Maneuver points have to be spent when the concoction is brewed.
Drinking an elixir will trigger the effect, even if the person drinking it does not possess the skill and is not in range of the alchemist.
