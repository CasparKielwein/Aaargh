# Skills

### Arcane (Mind)
*Arcane* represents the characters knowledge of occult lore, spells, and magical beasts.
Use it to identify strange phenomenons, places, creatures, and spells.
The *Arcane* skill is used to perform many rituals.

### Religion (Mind)
In a world of gods and demons, knowledge of these beings and their realms is of particular importance.
*Religion* is useful to identify beings of the spiritual realms as well as mortal cults and religions.
Characters can use *Religion* to perform prayers and rituals.

### Nature (Mind)
Heroes use the *Nature* skill to identify plants and beasts as well as navigate through and survive the wilderness.

### Athletics (Tough)
Jump, swim, climb, run long distances, etc.

### Perception (Mind)
Roll *Perception* to find hidden threats, traps, and detect ambushes.

### Streetwise (Mind)
The *Streetwise* skill represents the characters ability to identify potential allies and threats in an urban environment.
In particular roll *Streetwise* when you want to find out if someone is deceiving you.

### Stealth (Dex)

### Charm (Mind)

### Intimidate (Mind)
Use *Intimidate* to make people do what you want them to against their will.
If you use *Intimidate* against someone, they will usually hold a grudge and work against you in the future.


### Comment
Nine Skills seems like a manageable number, which still covers the typical situations of a dungeon crawler.
Since Backgrounds give one or two proficiencies, Ancestries give one and classes give two, a group of four heroes should be able to cover all skills.
The Lore skills (Arcane, Religion, Nature) should allow nearly every character to be able to be the expert on a given enemy type once in a while.
Specialized knowledge is covered by tool/trade proficiencies.
In particular medicine is covered by proficiency in healers kit.


## Skill Disciplines
You can learn and advance in skill Disciplines if you are proficient in the related skill.
They allow you to develop a character in a direction not dictated by the choice of class.

### Ritualist (Arcane, Religion)
You know how to perform powerful rituals.
These take more time to cast than normal spells and might require exotic materials as paraphernalia.

### Herbalist (Nature)
You know how to collect and use herbs and other natural ingredients for their helpful effects.

#### Comment
The herbalist discipline allows characters who are not spellcasters and do not necessarily have a high *mind* stat to heal and buff their allies.
This way one can build a forest ranger type character who supports their allies without resorting to magic.

### "Jump Very High" (Athletics)
