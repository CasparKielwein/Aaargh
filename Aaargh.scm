,(section :title [Design Principles][
,(itemize (item [As much as necessary as little as possible!
Every rule and every character option has to justified and improve the game.
Prefer a chain of options instead of one large pool.])
          (item [Rules work together!
We try to make sure all parts of the rule system interact with one another.
They should never feel like a set of parallel or tacked-on parts.])
          (item [Prefer simple operations!
We want to minimize the cognitive burden put on players.
Thus, both the number of and the strength of calculations necessary during play should be low.
Comparing to numbers is simpler than calculation. Addition is simpler than subtraction.
Multiplication with and division by any other number than 10 and 2 is to be avoided.])
          (item [Avoid Bookkeeping!
We avoid resources with large numbers as they usually requires more calculations.
Numbers should be kept in a range, where they can be easily represented by small physical tokens.
7 is often a good maximum for numbers which a human is to keep in their mind.
Hit Points might be an exception.])
          (item [Avoid bonus stacking!
Players should not be required to add more than 3 to 4 numbers to calculate the result of a roll.
Having a lot of different manipulators in play makes it hard to estimate the effect of a given choice or action.
In particular avoid dynamic and situational modifiers. Use advantage and disadvantage instead.]))
