,(section :title [Fanmail][
If a player or his character does anything that pleases the other players (including the GM), he can get a point of fanmail for that;
players suggest people for fanmail, and unless someone has a veto, they get the point.
You can't give fanmail to yourself, though.
Fanmail can be accumulated endlessly, and there is no strict limit on how many may be given, but more than 5 per player per session of play should be highly unusual
Per thing that pleases, only one fanmail may be given, even if it pleases multiple players.

Stuff that might qualify include athmospheric roleplaying, a clever joke, a clever tactic,
taking one for the team or other teamplay, being very useful in the adventure and advancing the plot, as a consolation for some frustration suffered during play (but endured well) etc.

You may also award fanmail for certain out of game things like writing a session report, creating a map or other illustration etc.
fanmail can then be used for (temporary) advantages during play; once it has been used it is gone and must be earned anew.

,(itemize (item [1 pt: can be used like a point of endurance or a powerpoint])
        (item [1 pt: add 1d4 bonus to a d20 or damage roll])
        (item [3 pts: reroll a d20 check or damage roll, taking the better result])
        (item [6 pts: add a second action to your turn]))

Generally speaking, you may not gain stuff you already have from the normal rules; so for example if you attack with advantage, you can't reroll that attack - you already rolled 2 dice and picked the better one

There is also *some* player empowerment:

,(itemize (item [for 3 points you can introduce a minor fact or friendly NPC])
        (item [for 6 points you can introduce a major fact or powerful/ very useful friendly NPC])
        (item [for 9 points you can have a miracle happen, save someone's life ingame or the like]))

New players who join the group start with 5 fanmail.
