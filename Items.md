### Comment
Blade Weapons have the greatest utility but generally do one die type less damage.
Feats and Manouvers targetting blade Weapons are better than those for Axes and Hammers.
Axes have the highest potential for damage having the *devastating* attribute and feats supporting conditionally damage boni.
Hammers are have the highest average damage. Feats supporting hammres add debuffs that are usefeull for low damage builds.
