# Weapons

### Comment
The Equipment rules are not realistic.
They are designed to be fun and enable strong visuals and action scenes.

For Weapon focused Heroes the choice of weapon is a choice of damage potential vs secondary effects and utility vs defense.
The damage of spellcasters does not depend as much on the weapon.
Thus, it is a choice between different utilities and secondary effects and defense.

## Weapon Properties
* Versatile: The weapon can be used one-handed or two-handed. If used two-handed the damage die increases by one type.
* Reach: The weapon can be used to attack enemies up to 10ft away.
* 2H: The weapon can only be used with two hands.
* Devastating: Critical hits with this weapon deal extra damage. A critical hit deals an extra 1[W] damage at levels 1-10, 2[W] at levels 11-20 and 3[W] at levels 21 to 25.
* Sharp(x): When rolling the weaponâ€™s damage results in a roll lower than the sharp value of the weapon for any die, the damage of that roll is considered the sharp value of the weapon instead.
* Load: After making an attack with the weapon, the user needs to spend an opportunity action to reload the weapon, before they can attack with it again.
* Light: Attacks with this Weapon can be made with *Dexterity* or *Toughness*.

### Comment
Blade Weapons have the greatest utility but generally do one die type less damage than Axes.
Talents and Maneuvers targeting blade Weapons are better than those for Axes and Hammers.
Axes have the highest potential for damage having the *devastating* attribute and talents supporting conditionally damage boni.
Hammers are have the highest average damage. Talents supporting hammers add debuffs that are useful for low damage builds.
Crossbows do more damage than bows, but the `Load` Attribute limits them to one attack per round.
Thrown Weapons do even less damage but provide versatility by being one-handed and also usable as melee weapons.

Everyone can wear every armor, there are no restriction for class or attribute values.
Talents and Magic Items encourage using lighter armor to advance certain play-styles.

## Magic and Legendary Items
### Comment
Legendary Items are basically part of the characters.
They are highly relevant to balancing and often part of a character build. (As magic items tend to be in Dnd)

Legendary Items do not have prices attached.

Magic Items are weaker, smaller etc.
They can be bought and sold.

If an item is powerful and specific enough to be part of a character build, it should be a legendary item.


### Magic Items

#### Endless Quiver

### Legendary Items
To use a legendary item, you need to learn its secrets.
Each Secret you uncover unlocks a new ability of the Legendary Item.

#### Weapon of Surtur
Any Weapon or spellcaster implement

When you speak a command word as a free action, the weapon of Surtur will burst in flames.
All damage caused by attacks and spells using it is fire damage.

#### Robes of the Archmage
Cloth robes, no real amor.

* You start each encounter with one additional Power-Point

#### Conduit Armor

You gain resistance to lightning damage.
Whenever you take lightning damage ou deal half of that damage to each creature adjacent to you.

#### Hammer of the Thundergod

#### Songblade
Any blade weapon  
The songblade emits unnatural sounds and music when you fight with it.
It counts as a muiscal instrument and you are automatically proficient with it.

### Berserker Armor
Barely any armor, mostly the hide of bears.

Light Armor suited for melee fighters
