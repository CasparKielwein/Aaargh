# Aaargh
Aaargh another Action RPG!

Aaargh is a free and open pen and paper RPG in the vein of Dungeons and Dragons.

## Mission Statement
Aaargh continues where Dnd4 and 5 left off. It offers fast yet tactical combat with a lot of options to customize your characters and let them fight their way through any imaginable adventure. It offers a wide range of character options without geting lost in minute detail together with a streamlined gameplay. The characters are heroes who leave their mark on the world.

## Design Goals
* Heroes kick ass! The characters are larger than life heroes and should feel like that.
* Tactical combat, combat is dangerous and requires good decision making and flexibility. It must never be a case of just going through ones optimal skill rotation.
* Decisions are important, every decision during character creation and play should feel significant. There shall be no must haves
* No noob traps. There shall be now bad options during character creation. If any option is never taken because its alternatives are plain better, we will fix it.
* The intuitive option has to work. When a total beginner builds a straight forward character and makes his choices based on what seems right, it should not be wrong. Less apparent ideas might require more consideration and insight into the system but everyone should be able to build a "Kill Stuff with a giant Axe" type of character that kicks ass.
* Consistent Core Rules. Once a player gets a grasp how the rules work, it should be easy to guess how they apply to a specific situation.
Never should anybody but the player of a character need to know the specific rules of that character.

## What Aaargh is not
* A Simulation, Aaargh is focused on action and dangerous adventures in a fantastic world. It does not simulate the reality.
* Balanced for player versus player fights.

## What's with the name?
aaargh is a working title, it might or might not get a serious name later.
