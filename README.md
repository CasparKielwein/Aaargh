# Aaargh
Aaargh another Action RPG!

Aaargh is a free and open pen and paper RPG in the vein of Dungeons and Dragons.

## Mission Statement
Aaargh continues where Dnd4 and 5 left off. It offers fast yet tactical combat with a lot of options to customize your characters and let them fight their way through any imaginable adventure. It offers a wide range of character options without geting lost in minute detail together with a streamlined gameplay. The characters are heroes who leave their mark on the world.

## Design Goals
* Heroes kick ass! The characters are larger than life heroes and should feel like that.
* Tactical combat, combat is dangerous and requires good decision making and flexibility. It must never be a case of just going through an optimal skill rotation.
* Accessable, the rules should be easy to understand and allow people to quickly start playing.

## Secondary Goals
* Decisions are important, every decision during character creation and play should feel significant. There shall be no must haves
* No noob traps. There shall be now bad options during character creation. If any option is never taken because its alternatives are plain better, we will fix it.
* The intuitive option has to work. When a total beginner builds a straight forward character and makes his choices based on what seems right, it should not be wrong. Less apparent ideas might require more consideration and insight into the system but everyone should be able to build a "Kill Stuff with a giant Axe" type of character that kicks ass.
* Consistent Core Rules. Once a player gets a grasp how the rules work, it should be easy to guess how they apply to a specific situation.
Never should anybody but the player of a character need to know the specific rules of that character.
* Good Balancing, try to always make different options well balanced. This is a continous process.

## What Aaargh is not
* A Simulation, Aaargh is focused on action and dangerous adventures in a fantastic world. It does not simulate the reality.
* A game of subtle horror, Characters in Aaargh are larger than life heroes who are scared of very few things.
* Balanced for player versus player fights.

## Design Principles:
* As much as necessary as little as possible!
Every rule and every character option has to justified and improve the game.
Prefer a chain of options instead of one large pool.
* Rules work together!
We try to make sure all parts of the rule system interact with one another.
They should never feel like a set of parallel or tacked-on parts.
* Prefer simple operations!  
We want to minimize the cognitive burden put on players. 
Thus, both the number of and the strength of calculations necessary during play should be low.
Comparing to numbers is simpler than calculation. Addition is simpler than subtraction.
Multiplication with and division by any other number than 10 and 2 is to be avoided.
* Avoid Bookkeeping!  
We avoid resources with large numbers as they usually requires more calculations. 
Numbers should be kept in a range, where they can be easily represented by small physical tokens.
7 is often a good maximum for numbers which a human is to keep in their mind.  
Hit Points might be an exception.
* Avoid bonus stacking!  
Players should not be required to add more than 3 to 4 numbers to calculate the result of a roll.
Having a lot of different manipulators in play makes it hard to estimate the effect of a given choice or action.
In particular avoid dynamic and situational modifiers; use advantage and disadvantage instead.

## What's with the name?
aaargh is a working title, it might or might not get a serious name later.
