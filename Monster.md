# Monster

## Threat
### Troop
Troops are regular opponents without any modifiers

### Minion
Minions only have 1 HP.
They never take damage by attacks that miss them, or when they succeed in a save.

Four Minions are roughly equivalent to a troop monster.

### Elite
An Elite monster has the strength of roughly four troops.

### Nemesis
A Nemesis has the strength of roughly ten regular troops.

## Level
Monsters have a proficiency bonus, just like the Heroes.
The proficiency bonus is a rough estimate of a monsters level.
A bonus of zero indicates, that the monster really isn't a fighter, and probably only ever attacks in very large numbers.
A bonux of six, the maximum, indicates a true master.

Add the proficiency bonus to all Attack and skill roles and secondary defenses.

A troop Threat monster has roughly the same HP, Attacks, and Defenses as a Hero with the same proficiency bonus but it lakes the powerful abilities of the Hero disciplines.

A proficiency bonus of +2 is the baseline for an average soldier without any special training.

## Hit Points
TODO: How to calculate monster hit points
In particular, how to calculate their increase per level.

### Base HP
Similar to lvl 1 heroes:
* 6 + Toughness for squishy types
* 8 + Toughness for hardy types and most beasts
* 10 + Toughness for warriors and soldiers

## Modifiers
Use Modifier templates to increase the level of a monster and give them new abilities.
These templates represent better trained, armed, motivated etc. representations of their kind.

### Well equiped
Better equiped than most
* Proficiency Bonus +1 representing not increased skill, but quality of equipment
* Damage +2 for one-handed or +4 for two-handed weapons

### Veteran
Have seen combat and know how to fight
* Proficiency Bouus +1
* Base HP x2 resembling increased fitness and morale.

### Elite
requires and replaces Veteran
* Proficiency Bouus +2
* Base HP x3 resembling increased fitness and morale.

### Ganak Transformation
* Tough + 1
* HP + 5

#### Ability: Unnerving Howl
The Ganak emits a terrible howl, putting fear into their victims heart.

Attack +4 against will
The target is terrified; save ends.

When the Ganak attack, they will start with their howl before making contact.
Thus terrified enemies will often roll initiative with disadvantage.

## Ganak
Ganak are humans or members of other civilized ancestries that have become corrupted by the power of the titans. This can be contagious, leading to ganak outbreaks. They are somewhat mutated and their mind is twisted and savage. As such they resemble tolkiens orcs from the films or darkspawn from the dragon age series. While they can cooperate somewhat and also work with other servants of the titans to a degree, they are invariably savage and violent, favouring strong leaders like titanblooded. 
Ganak breed true and can multiply a fair bit faster than humans or most ancestries. It's not uncommon for them to have breeding camps where both female ganak and captives are used to make more ganak in an almost industrial fashion. 
Infected people that transform usually get a serious fever (which kills quite some infected) and emerge as ganak after maybe a week. Onset is typically a few days. Usually this happens when captives are force fed ganak blood, or when food and water supplies are tainted, often by sorcerous means. 
Ganak aren't very good farmers or craftsmen though, so wise leaders avoid converting their entire population and just keep some ganak on hand for times of war or when violence is otherwise needed, like supressing uprisings. 

### Ganak Thrall
These are badly equipped and trained ganak, often the result of mass transformations. Sometimes ganak keep their weak spawn as a seperate caste resembling slaves and still use them in war, they can also use these stats. 

__Attributes:__ Tough: 1	Agil: 1		Mind: 0  
__Defenses:__  	AC 14 Fort 13 Dex 13	Will 12  
__HP:__ 1 (minion)

Spiked club, spear or similar cheap/primitve weapon	+3	1d6+1 damage
Thrown Rocks or similar primitive ranged weapon  	+3	1d4+1 damage

#### Gear:
Dirty armor made of leather and cloth  
simple wooden shield  
primitive weapons

#### Ganak Rager
These are brutal shock troops that charge into the enemy ranks without regard for their own life. Using two axes is fairly typical, as is using the toughest armor they can get. This is a prestigious profession among ganak, but they rarely live for long due to their aggressive behavior in battle. 

__Attributes:__ Tough: 3	Agil: 1		Mind: 0  
__Defenses:__  	AC 15 Fort 15 Dex 13	Will 12

#### Attacks

Ragers are utterly immune to fear and usually attack relentlessly until they win or are killed

#### Gear
Low quality medium metal armor, often made from various bits and pieces, similar to scale armor overall  
two battleaxes  
trophies taken from their previous victims
 
### Ganak Veteran Rager
These ragers have been tempered by battle, surviving multiple confrontations and likely having killed a great number of adversaries. They are a force to be reconned with. They often command groups of other ganak, which might be unwise. After all their tactics concentrate on charging the enemy and they are even more prone to violence than other ganak or even other ragers. All in all they lack most of the qualities that make a good officer and leader, but their sheer ferocity still allows them to be somewhat effective.

__Defenses:__  	AC 18 Fort 17 Dex 15	Will 13

On a hit they take 3d4 psychic damage and are frightened
On a miss they aren't frightened but still take half psychic damage

#### Gear
Two greataxes, possibly of good quality or even magical
A full plate
Trophies taken from their previous victims

### Ganak Bowmen
While they are armed with bows, they are general purpose soldiers most of the time, also carrying serviceable melee weapons and wearing decent armor. They often have small shields strapped to their offhand underarm that add some protection while still allowing them to use a bow.
