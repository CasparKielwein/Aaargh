You are a Sorcerer, as master of the arcane forces!

,(subsection :title [Comment][
    Sorcerers are the catchall spellcaster class.
    Of all classes, they have the largest number of active abilities available as many of their disciplines add new powers with higher ranks.
    Wizards have more utility, Warlocks deal more damage.

    Sorcerers have more diversity and utilities in their abilities than godsworn or druids.
    They are very much focussed on their spell abilities and lack the defining abilities
    of godsworn and druids which are not active spells.

    Higher level Abilities of Sorcerers are often new powerful spells.
    This differentiates them from Godsworn Disciplines which mostly add effects and options to a base Maneuver.

Every Sorcerer obtained their magical powers through a different source, from ancient tomes to pacts with otherworldly beings.

,(subsubsection :title [Ancient Lore][
    You acquired your knowledge of the arcane by studying ancient books and scrolls. Maybe you formally enrolled in a magic academy or found them in decrypt ruins.
    You gain an additional two Power-Points after a long rest.

    When gaining a new Discipline Level you can choose to gain an additional Maneuver from the same Level of a Discipline you already own.

    You forged a terrible pact with a powerful being. It gave you fantastic powers, but they come with a price which could be horrible indeed.
