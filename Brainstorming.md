# Brainstorming

This file contains unsorted ideas.

## Power-Point Mechanisms.
* Damage Self / Trade HP for Power-Points
* Damage Allies for Power-Points
* Gain Power-Point on Kill
* Start the turn adjacent to a large number of enemies
* End the turn adjacent to a large number of enemies

## Talents
* Maybe Bard as a talent? What should it do?

## Powers
Single Powers, aka Discipline Ranks

## Class Features

## Non-Combat abilities
Every class should have a choice of at least two non-combat abilities.
They emphasize how the character acts and solves problems.

### Fighter
* Die Axt im Haus erspart den Zimmermann
You can use your weapons as tools to gain advantage on skill checks.
* Born Leader
You gain advantage on rolls to make others follow your command. 

### Godsworn
* Beacon of Hope
You gain advantage on rolls to convince someone to do the right thing.
They have to believe that it is the right thing to do what you want for this ability to work.

### Druid
* Talk to Animals
You can talk to beasts of the natural world. They still think like beasts and are not necessarily friendly to you.

### Sorcerer
* Each Magic Discipline allows use of small "cantrips".
Appropriate use of these in a challange gives advantage on skill checks

### Rogue
* Pickpocket
* Lockpick
You gain advantage on rolls to pick locks or manipulate delicate mechanisms.
* Charlatan, 
you gain advantage when you roll to convince someone, you are someone or something other than you really are.

Sage: 
When you have the chance to do ressearch as preparation before you embark on a quest, you gain advantage on all monster-knowledge checks during that quest.

Polyglot:
You can communicate in basically every spoken language.
While you might not speak every language, you always know enough adjacent ideoms to make yourself understood.

Perfekt Memory:
You remember astonashing details about past events.

Trick Archery:
You can perform amazing feats of archery.
Cut ropes, split one arrow with the next etc.

Everything has a Price
After spending a short time to observer somone you know how they can be bought or bribed to do what you want from them.

## Defender abilities
Defenders *mark* opponents. Any Creature can only ever be marked by one opponent.
If it is marked again, the second mark is applied and the older is lost.
being marked does not give any immediate effect but heroes have abilities which allow them to react when a marked creature makes an attack which does not include the hero who marked them.

Each class has an ability to mark opponents in a different way and each has different ways to react 

### Fighter
Combat Challenge:  
When the fighter attacks a target they can decide to mark all targets of the attack.
If a marked creature is adjacent to the fighter and attacks ally or moves the fighter can make an attack as a reaction.
If at the end of the fighters turn, a marked creature is not in attack range of the fighter, the creature is not marked anymore.

The fighter defends by forcing enemies to stay close to the fighter or suffer potentially devastating attacks.
Fighters don't have to spend extra actions to maintain a mark, but they have to stay in combat range of the target.

### Godsworn

Divine Challange:  
Free Action: Mark an enemy within in 25'.
If an enemy marked by your divine sanction makes an attack which does not include you as a target it takes X damage.

### Druid

Primal Challange:
Minor Action: You mark every enemy within 10''

### Rogue

Idea:
Rogues mark targets but don't really defend, they don't stop or weaken the attack of the enemy, but they can attack with especially deadly attacks.

### Sorcerer

### Ideas:
* Give marked enemies disadvantage on attack
* Allow attack against marked enemy (fighter combat challange)
* Cause immediate damage against the target
* Make marked target vulnerable to attacks (gain advantage or target gains vulnerability to damage)
* Forced movement on target

## How-To Archetypes

  * Fighter, Rage Martial Discipline, Greataxe as Weapon
    * How can he stay tough without heavy armor?

* Elven Archer
  * Elf, Fighter, Focus Discipline, Longbow, Light Armor 
* Fire Wizard

## Class Simple Options
Each class should have an option which is straight forward to play.
This is for players who really don't want to bother with complex mechanics.

Fighter: "Strength and Training"
Rogue:
Sorcerer: Wizard
Godsworn: Choose a simple domain
Druid: Form of the warden, or beast companion, Which Circle?

## Rituals
Rituals are spells for longer effects and spellcasting time.
They are not suitable for use during combat.

Power-Points spent to perform a ritual cannot be regained while the ritual is in effect.

## Trigger events
These can be used for disciplines and regaining Power-Points.

  * All Weapon Attacks deal twice the normal amount of damage dice
  * Lumbering Beast: Attacks against medium and small enemies with disadvantage, but deal a lot of damage
  * Sweep Attack, Attack all enemies in front
* Gargantuan
  * All Weapon Attacks deal dour times the normal amount of damage dice
  * Trample, move through medium or small enemies, damage them as you go

### Weapons and signature abilities
Signature abilities are usually available to monsters who wield those weapons.
This makes it clear to players what they can expect.

Players can get them through talents or class abilities.

#### Polearm
* Brace Polearm
You have threatening reach, you can perform opportunity attacks within the complete reach of the weapon

#### Crossbow
* Load
You need to use a move action to load the weapon after an attack before you can attack again.  
Very high damage.

#### Two-Handed Sword
* Reaping Strike
When you deal damage with an attack, a second target adjacent to you takes half the original damage as well.

#### Heavy Two-Handed (Axe, Hammer)
Devastating Crit

#### Shield
* Tower Shield
Ranged Attacks which target you have disadvantage.

#### Two-Weapons
When you make an attack with one weapon you can make an attack with you second weapon as a Minor Action.
Monsters with multiple weapons will generally do one Attack per Weapon.
This includes Claws, Teeth, Spiked Tails, etc.

#### Light Blade (Short Sword, Dagger)
Sneak Attack: once per turn when you make an attack roll with advantage and you hit, you deal 1/2/3 d6 additional damage.

#### Bow
Todo

#### Thrown Weapons
TODO

#### Fencing Weapon
* Riposte
If a melee attack misses you, you can strike back at the attacker with a fencing weapon as a reaction.

### Damage Types and secondary effects.
* Physical Damage is the most common type of damage caused by most weapons and several spells.
    * push back, pull, knock prone,
    * ongoing damage
* Fire
    * ongoing fire damage 
* Cold
    * slow, immobilized
* Lightning
    * second physical "thunder" damage 
    * stun 
* Poison
    * ongoing poison damage
    * "acid" damage vulnerability
* Psychic
    * Force target to attack an ally  

### Passive Abilities
These could be talents or special abilities of magic items.

* Use Throwing weapons to transform melee area attacks to ranged area attacks.
With a Throwing Weapon: When you make a melee weapon attack, which targets enemies in a circle around you,
you can place that circle anywhere within your throwing weapons range.

### Paragon Path Concepts
* Life Stealer 
  When you kill an enemy, you drain their live force and gain a life spark.
  You can spend life sparks for additional effects on powers.
* Build up charges when you use Power-Points, when you reach the limit, bad things happen.
* Build up charges, when you reach a threshold you can expend them for additional power.

### Sustaining Effects
Since all Powers are payed in Power-Points when cast, the question is how to balance powers which have an enduring effect.
This is less of an issue in games where higher level spells with such effects can only be cast in low numbers.

* The effect is very localized and can easily be avoided, like difficult terrain: No additional cost
* Duration ~5min / one encounter, High Cost in Power-Points
* Duration until extended Rest: high cost, weak effect
* Sustain with an action: combat action, move, minor depending on strength of effect.
* Pay Power-Points each round, 5min / encounter to sustain effect.
* Take damage each round, 5min / encounter to sustain effect.
* Suffer Malus while effect is active
* Only one effect of a type can be active at the same time.

# Game-master Guide

These guidelines are never hundred percent.

### The players are the heroes of the Story
Put the player Characters in the centre of your stories.
Where more powerful Non-player-characers appear they should stay at the sidelines and not interfere much with the heroes.
In particular avoid having powerful NPCs solve core elements of the plot.

### Avoid taking the heroes prisoner
Players usually hate it if their Characters are taken prisoner.
It takes away their agency and contradicts the fantasy of being a hero who might be beaten down but never surrenders.

### Employ heavy Foreshadowing
When the heroes enter a new area, or a new threat enters their current area of operation, let them know what problems they should expect.
Put the players on the edge and maybe give them some chance to prepare before introducing a thread in a combat encounter.
This gives you more leeway to create the encounter fitting for the story without the risk of killing all your players in a surprise encounter with an unknown enemy.
Examples
* Smoke columns and the smell of smoouldering ruins indicate violant warbands
* Rebels hanging from gallows or branches of a tree with written signs from a brutal tyrant.
* A dragon or other flying beast flies over them in the distance

### Be Careful with Ambushes
In an ambush, the attacker has a great advantage.
If monsters ambush the SCs, an otherwise well balanced encounter can quickly turn into a total party kill.
