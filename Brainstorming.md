# Brainstorming

This file contains unsorted ideas.

## Power Point Mechanisms.
* Damage Self / Trade HP for Power Points
* Damage Allies for Power Points
* Gain Power Point on Kill
* Start the turn adjacent to a large number of enemies
* End the turn adjacent to a large number of enemies

## Talents
* Maybe Bard as a talent? What should it do?

## Powers
Single Powers, aka Discipline Ranks

## Class Features

## Backgrounds
Each Background has a table of *Features* and a *Problem*
The Feature is not related to combat abilities.
The Problem is a plot hook for adventures of ca the first ten levels.

* Noble
    * Feature: Retainers or Holding
    * Problem: Enemy, Holding in Decline
* On the run
    * Feature: Survivors Instinct; Something about finding resources out of nothing
    * Had to flee something, lost nearly everything
    * Problem: Find a Safe place or clear your name
* Soldier
    * Feature, Solders etc. will generally be friendly and help
    * Problem:
* Acolyte
* Outcast

## Non-Combat abilities
Every class should have a choice of at least two non-combat abilities.
They emphasize how the character acts and solves problems.

### Fighter
* Die Axt im Haus erspart den Zimmermann
You can use your weapons as tools to gain advantage on skill checks.
* Born Leader
You gain advantage on rolls to make others follow your command. 

### Godsworn
* Beacon of Hope
You gain advantage on rolls to convince someone to do the right thing.
They have to believe that it is the right thing to do what you want for this ability to work.

### Druid
* Talk to Animals
You can talk to beasts of the natural world. They still think like beasts and are not necessarily friendly to you.

### Sorcerer
* Each Magic Discipline allows use of small "cantrips".
Appropriate use of these in a challange gives advantage on skill checks

### Rogue
* Pickpocket
* Lockpick
You gain advantage on rolls to pick locks or manipulate delicate mechanisms.
* Charlatan, you gain advantage when you roll to convince someone, you are someone or something other than you really are.

## Defender abilities
Defenders *mark* opponents. Any Creature can only ever be marked by one opponent.
If it is marked again, the second mark is applied and the older is lost.
being marked does not give any immediate effect but heroes have abilities which allow them to react when a marked creature makes an attack which does not include the hero who marked them.

Each class has an ability to mark opponents in a different way and each has different ways to react 

### Fighter
Combat Challenge:  
When the fighter attacks a target they can decide to mark all targets of the attack.
If a marked creature is adjacent to the fighter and attacks ally or moves the fighter can make an attack as a reaction.
If at the end of the fighters turn, a marked creature is not in attack range of the fighter, the creature is not marked anymore.

The fighter defends by forcing enemies to stay close to the fighter or suffer potentially devastating attacks.
Fighters don't have to spend extra actions to maintain a mark, but they have to stay in combat range of the target.

### Godsworn

Divine Challange:  
Free Action: Mark an enemy within in 25'.
If an enemy marked by your divine sanction makes an attack which does not include you as a target it takes X damage.

### Druid

Primal Challange:
Reaction: You mark every enemy within 10''

### Rogue

Idea:
Rogues mark targets but don't really defend, they don't stop or weaken the attack of the enemy, but they can attack with especially deadly attacks.

### Sorcerer

### Ideas:
* Give marked enemies disadvantage on attack
* Allow attack against marked enemy (fighter combat challange)
* Cause immediate damage against the target
* Make marked target vulnerable to attacks (gain advantage or target gains vulnerability to damage)
* Forced movement on target

## How-To Archetypes

  * Fighter, Rage Martial Discipline, Greataxe as Weapon
    * How can he stay tough without heavy armor?

  * Fighter, Focus Discipline, Heavy Armor, Sword + Shield
  * Godsworn, Oath of the Protector, Heavy Armor, Sword + Shield

* Elven Archer
  * Elf, Fighter, Focus Discipline, Longbow, Light Armor 
* Fire Wizard
* Bard

## Class Simple Options
Each class should have an option which is straight forward to play.
This is for players who really don't want to bother with complex mechanics.

Fighter: "Strength and Training"
Rogue:
Sorcerer: Wizard
Godsworn: Choose a simple domain
Druid: Form of the warden, or beast companion, Which Circle?

## Rituals
Rituals are spells for longer effects and spellcasting time.
They are not suitable for use during combat.

Power-Points spent to perform a ritual cannot be regained while the ritual is in effect.

## Trigger events
These can be used for disciplines and regaining power points.

### Very Common (expected at least once per turn)
* Attack an enemy (you / ally)
* enemy attacks an ally
* enemy attacks you
* you / ally / enemy move
* start your turn
* end your turn

### Common (expected at least once per round)
* hit for each possible attack

* you are bloodied
* an ally drops to 0 hit points
* an enemy triggers an opportunity attack
* you / enemy / ally is subjected to forced movement

### Very Rare (at most once per encounter)

### Monster Sizes
* Small
* Medium
The most common size, almost all player characters are medium size
* Large
  * All Weapon Attacks deal twice the normal amount of damage dice
  * Lumbering Beast: Attacks against medium and small enemies with disadvantage, but deal a lot of damage
  * Sweep Attack, Attack all enemies in front
* Gargantuan
  * All Weapon Attacks deal dour times the normal amount of damage dice
  * Trample, move through medium or small enemies, damage them as you go

### Weapons and signature abilities
Signature abilities are usually available to monsters who wield those weapons.
This makes it clear to players what they can expect.

Players can get them through talents or class abilities.

#### Polearm
* Brace Polearm
You have threatening reach, you can perform opportunity attacks within the complete reach of the weapon

#### Crossbow
* Load
You need to use a move action to load the weapon after an attack before you can attack again.  
Very high damage.

#### Two-Handed Sword
* Reaping Strike
When you deal damage with an attack, a second target adjacent to you takes half the original damage as well.

#### Heavy Two-Handed (Axe, Hammer)
Devastating Crit

#### Shield
* Tower Shield
Ranged Attacks which target you have disadvantage.

#### Two-Weapons
When you make an attack with one weapon you can make an attack with you second weapon as a reaction.
Monsters with multiple weapons will generally do one Attack per Weapon.
This includes Claws, Teeth, Spiked Tails, etc.

#### Light Blade (Short Sword, Dagger)
Sneak Attack: once per turn when you make an attack roll with advantage and you hit, you deal 1/2/3 d6 additional damage.

### Damage Types and secondary effects.
* Physical Damage is the most common type of damage caused by most weapons and several spells.
    * push back, pull, knock prone,
    * ongoing damage
* Fire
    * ongoing fire damage 
* Cold
    * slow, immobilized
* Lightning
    * second physical "thunder" damage 
    * stun 
* Poison
    * ongoing poison damage
    * "acid" damage vulnerability
* Psychic
    * Force target to attack an ally  

### Passive Abilities
These could be talents or special abilities of magic items.

* Use Throwing weapons to transform melee area attacks to ranged area attacks.
With a Throwing Weapon: When you make a melee weapon attack, which targets enemies in a circle around you,
you can place that circle anywhere within your throwing weapons range.

### Paragon Path Concepts
* Life Stealer 
  When you kill an enemy, you drain their live force and gain a life spark.
  You can spend life sparks for additional effects on powers.
* Build up charges when you use power points, when you reach the limit, bad things happen.
* Build up charges, when you reach a threshold you can expend them for additional power.

### Sustaining Effects
Since all Powers are payed in Power Points when cast, the question is how to balance powers which have an enduring effect.
This is less of an issue in games where higher level spells with such effects can only be cast in low numbers.

* The effect is very localized and can easily be avoided, like difficult terrain: No additional cost
* Duration ~5min / one encounter, High Cost in Power Points
* Duration until extended Rest: high cost, weak effect
* Sustain with an action: combat action, move, reaction depending on strength of effect.
* Pay Power-Points each round, 5min / encounter to sustain effect.
* Take damage each round, 5min / encounter to sustain effect.
* Suffer Malus while effect is active
* Only one effect of a type can be active at the same time.
