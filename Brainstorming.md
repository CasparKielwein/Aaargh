# Brainstorming

This file contains unsorted ideas.

## Power Point Mechanisms.
* Damage Self / Trade HP for Power Points
* Damage Allies for Power Points
* Gain Power Point on Kill
* Start the turn adjacent to a large number of enemies
* End the turn adjacent to a large number of enemies

## Talents
* Maybe Bard as a talent? What should it do?

## Powers
Single Powers, aka Discipline Ranks

## Class Features

## Backgrounds
Each Background has a table of *Features* and a *Problem*
The Feature is not related to combat abilities.
The Problem is a plot hook for adventures of ca the first ten levels.

* Noble
    * Feature: Retainers or Holding
    * Problem: Enemy, Holding in Decline
* On the run
    * Feature: Survivors Instinct; Something about finding ressources out of nothing
    * Had to flee something, lost nearly everything
    * Problem: Find a Safe place or clear your name
* Soldier
    * Feature, Solders etc. will generally be friendly and help
    * Problem:
* Acolyte
* Outcast

## Non-Combat abilitites
Every class should have a choice of at least two non-combat abilities.
They emphasis how the character acts and solves problems.

### Fighter
* Die Axt im Haus erspaart den Zimmermann
You can use your weapons as tools to gain advantage on skill checks.

### Godsworn

### Druid
* Talk to Animals

### Sorcerer
* Each Magic Discipline allows use of small "cantrips".
Appropriate use of these in a challange gives advantage on skill checks

### Rogue

## Defender abilities
Defenders *mark* opponents. Any Creature can only ever be marked by one opponent.
If it is marked again, the second mark is applied and the older is lost.
being marked does not give any immediate effect but heroes have abilities which allow them to react when a marked creature makes an attack which does not include the hero who marked them.

Each class has an ability to mark opponents in a different way and each has different ways to react 

### Fighter
Combat Challange:  
When the fighter attacks a target they can decide to mark all targets of the attack.
If a marked creature is adjacent to the fighter and attacks ally or moves the fighter can make an attack as a reaction.
If at the end of the fighters turn, a marked creature is not in attack range of the fighter, the creature is not marked anymore.

The fighter defends by forcing enemies to stay close to the fighter or suffer potentially devastating attacks.
Fighters don't have to spend extra actions to maintain a mark, but they have to stay in combat range of the target.

### Godsworn

Divine Sanction:  


### Druid

### Rogue

Idea:
Rogues mark targets but don't really defend, they don't stop or weaken the attack of the enemy, but they can attack with especially deadly attacks.

### Sorcerer

### Ideas:
* Give marked enemies disadvantage on attack
* Allow attack against marked enemy (fighter combat challange)
* Cause immediate damage against the target
* Make marked target vulnerable to attacks (gain advanage or target gains vulnerability to damage)
* Forced movement on target

## How-To Archetypes
* Barbarian with Huge Ass Axe
  * Fighter, Rage Martial Discipline, Greataxe as Weapon
    * How can he stay tough without heavy armor?
* Knight in shiny Armor
  * Fighter, Focus Discipline, Heavy Armor, Sword + Shield
  * Godsworn, Oath of the Protector, Heavy Armor, Sword + Shield
* Dwarf with Axe / Hammer
  * Dwarf, Fighter, Any Discipline, Heavy Armor, Axe / Hammer
* Elven Archer
* Fire Wizard
* Bard
* Dagger Rogue
* Longbow Ranger
* Two Blade Ranger

## Class Simple Options
Each class should have a option which is straight forward to play.

Fighter: "Strength and Training"
Rogue:
Sorcerer: Wizard
Oathsworn: Choose a simple domain
Druid: Form of the warden, or beast companion, Which Circle?
